The client.py must be used on an operating systhem, where is a webcam.
The Server.py listens on 127.0.0.1:5000.
The Server.py sends the picture to the 127.0.0.1:5000. 
If you (just as me) use the server on a virtual machine, you may need to forwarding the port.
Warning: the application uses all your CPU and Memory, becouse of the bad design.
